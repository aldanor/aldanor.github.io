My name is Ivan Smirnov. I'm a quant and a programmer interested in scientific computing,
data science, web technologies and anything nerdy in general.

I'm current located in Dublin, Ireland where I work as a quantitative researcher for
[Susquehanna](http://www.sig.com). Aside from that I do some open source development and I
spend a good portion of my free time hacking on various [side projects](https://github.com/aldanor), mostly in Python and Rust as of recent.

I'm originally from Moscow, Russia and I got my undergrad in Applied Math & Computer Science from
Moscow State University. Later on I joined the graduate program in Math Finance in University
of Alberta, Canada and I got my PhD just before joining SIG.

I'm also a musician with a bit of classical piano training and deep passion for both jazz
and electronic music. Whenever I'm not hacking or running, I'm most likely to be found
in my bedroom studio producing strange and obscure sounds.
